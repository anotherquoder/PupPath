things to add:
	* We want a thing where the dogs go out and find the path to the food, and the dog that finds a path to food first
	gets to go to it. 
		* An arraylist of integers for directions to food (arrayLists don't require the same number of things
		per row)
		* boolean for food found
		* linkedlist for dir directions 
		
		
- make a maze system based on chiseling. The Dog (automatic) will be used to scan the maze and see which areas of food 
are not accessed. Then we go on a loop or such to make it so that we can access teh food.
